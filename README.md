##  How to Use

1. Clone or copy this script (`generate_project.py`) and the config file (`project_config.yaml`) into any directory.

2. Edit `project_config.yaml` to define your desired folder structure. Example:

   ```yaml
   structure:
     - data/
     - data/raw/
     - notebooks/
     - src/
     - src/__init__.py
     - .gitignore
   ```

3. Run the script from your terminal:

   ```bash
   python generate_project.py my_project_name
   ```

4. It will create a new folder named `my_project_name/` with the full structure inside.
